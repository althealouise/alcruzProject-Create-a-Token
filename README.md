# alcruzProject-Create-a-Token
This project involves creating a contract in the Remix environment. The goal is to create a basic implementation of a token that can be minted and burned. Minting increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, while burning decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, given that the address has enough tokens to burn.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

1. It is ideal to use Remix for this project. Navigate to the Remix website at: https://remix.ethereum.org/.
2. In the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the sidebar.
3. Name the file anyway you want, just make sure you use ```.sol``` file extension.
4. Copy and paste the code from ```alcruzToken.sol``` in this repository.
5. Compile the code by clicking on the Solidity compiler icon in the sidebar. Make sure the version is configured correctly.
6. Click the blue compile button then click the "Deploy & Run Transactions" icon in the sidebar.
7. Click on the orange "Deploy" button.
8. Collapse your deployment and you will see all the declared variables.
9. Configure the values of these variables by checking the conditions stated in the requirements comment at the beginning of the code.
