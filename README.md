# alcruzProject-Create-a-Token
This Solidity project involves creating a contract in the Remix environment. The goal is to create a basic implementation of a token that can be minted and burned. Minting increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, while burning decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, given that the address has enough tokens to burn.

## Getting Started
